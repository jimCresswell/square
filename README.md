A very simple HTML and CSS 2D "game". This is essentially a proof of of concept lump of pre-alpha javascript which may or may not evolve into something re-usable. Currently there are some hard coded keys for moving the two characters around the screen.

To use

1) download
2) use broweserify to process main.js into square.js (see the deploy script), or edit the deploy script to deploy to your desired directory.
3) Use WASD or the arrow keys to move the little people around.

The concept is to see what kind of game engine can be built in web technologies without using canvas.
